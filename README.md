# Elena Giacomazzi's Internship (October 2022-April 2023)

This repository consists of the code I implemented during my internship at the lab. The [Overview.md file](https://github.com/Manem-Lab/elenagiacomazzi/blob/main/Overview.md) gives a short summary for each file and what I implemented or tested in it.

The [(How To Valeria PDF)](https://github.com/Manem-Lab/elenagiacomazzi/blob/main/HowToVALERIA.pdf) and [Markdown](https://github.com/Manem-Lab/elenagiacomazzi/blob/main/HowToVALERIA.md) files give the steps that I took to submit a python job to the machine.
